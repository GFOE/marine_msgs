# Single scan from an imaging sonar
#
# The X-axis is centered in the plane of the fan ("forward"), with Z down,
# in order to be consistent with the NED convention.
#
# For sonars with a 1D array, the beams lie on the X-Y plane, and
# and each beam has an azimuth (rotation about Z) value.  Zero azimuth
# is in the direction of the X-axis, typically "straight out" from the sonar.
# Elevation is the orthogonal direction (rotation about Y),
# often termed the "vertical aperture"

# The meaning of the header timestamp relative to the sonar's data
# acquisition cycle is defined by the sonar driver. It is taken to be
# a best estimate of the time when the sonar data is valid, which will
# the timing information available from the sonar hardware.
